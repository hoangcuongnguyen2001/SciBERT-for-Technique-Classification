# SciBERT Fine-tuned for Cyber Attack Technique Classification
This is my repository of code and data for my Honours projects: **Analysing Technique Classification Performance of Cyber Threat Intelligence Extractors**. This is my training pipeline for SciBERT (a Large Language Model based on BERT): [SciBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Scientific Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676).

This Large Language Model is used to extract attack techniques from threat intelligence reports, as a basis for TRAM program: [TRAM](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram) from Center of Threat-Informed Defense by MITRE Corporation. 

By training this model with a new dataset, from [Barbaraci and Natella, 2022](https://github.com/dessertlab/cti-to-mitre-with-nlp), rebalanced it with synthetic data generated by ChatGPT, and adjusting training epochs, we were able to improve the F1-score of TRAM by 7 percentage points compared to the original version of TRAM.
