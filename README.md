# SciBERT Fine-tuned for Cyber Attack Technique Classification
This is my repository of code and data for the paper: **Towards Effective Identification of Attack Techniques in Cyber Threat Intelligence Reports using Large Language Models**, which was accepted in The Web Conference 2025: https://www2025.thewebconf.org/.

The code here is the fine-tuning pipeline for the SciBERT Large Language Model (a Large Language Model based on BERT): [SciBERT: A Pretrained Language Model for Scientific Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10676). This is used to extract attack techniques from threat intelligence reports, as a basis for TRAM program: [TRAM](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/tram) from Center of Threat-Informed Defense by MITRE Corporation. 

By fine-tuning this model with a new dataset, from [Barbaraci and Natella, 2022](https://github.com/dessertlab/cti-to-mitre-with-nlp), rebalanced it with synthetic data generated by ChatGPT, and adjusting training epochs, we were able to improve the F1-score of TRAM by 7 percentage points compared to the original version of TRAM. 

The structure of our pipeline could be shown in this image (the pipeline number 4). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8db398da-5957-4e73-b22c-6d1f36c29b31)



## Repository details

This repository includes: 
- Original CTI reports for analysis; this could be accessed from `Original_Reports` folder;
- Google Colab notebook for extracting attack techniques names and examples from MITRE ATT&CK framework (from `mitre_attack_retrieve.ipynb` file).
- Google Colab notebooks deployed for the final pipeline (number 4 in the image shown above). This could be accessed from `Colab_Notebooks/Fine_tune_SciBERT_for_new_pipelines.ipynb`. Another attempt (without rebalancing data) is shown in `Colab_Notebooks/Fine_tune_SciBERT_for_CTI_analysis_from_TRAM.ipynb`.
- Comparison between the results of different pipelines. This could be accessed from `Colab_Notebooks/Graph_comparison.ipynb`.
- The training dataset `training_dataset.json` is based on `TRAM_fine-tuned.json` (the result from rebalancing dataset by GPT-3.5) and `TRAM_fine-tuned_SciBERT.json` (the initial dataset).
  
Anyone could run the Colab notebooks standalone, since the data has been made available in Google Drive. Please note that the related data contains data from my thesis and some could not make it into the research paper.

For further information about my own works, please look at my thesis ( **Analysing Technique Classification Performance of Cyber Threat Intelligence Extractors**, which my paper is a part of) here: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XVyrp7QPhTO1ETJA6rOYtpVwLV0XBY82/view?usp=sharing), or in the `Analysing Technique Classification Performance.pdf` file. For any further questions, please contact my email address in GitHub profile.
